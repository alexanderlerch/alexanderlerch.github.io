A large number of audio features are evaluated for their suitability in such a classification task, including well-known physical and perceptual features, audio descriptors defined in the MPEG-7 standard, as well as new features proposed in this work. These are selected with regard to their ability to distinguish between a given set of audio types and to their robustness to noise and bandwidth changes. In contrast to previous systems, the feature selection and the classification process itself are carried out in a hierarchical way. This is motivated by the numerous advantages of such a tree-like structure, which include easy expansion capabilities, flexibility in the design of genre-dependent features and the ability to reduce the probability of costly errors. The resulting application is evaluated with respect to classification accuracy and computational costs.},

Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the generator with an additional input condition: the theme or overarching topic of the lyrics to be generated. We show that the input conditions have no negative impact on the evaluation metrics while enabling the network to produce more meaningful results.},

In many cases, such models are expected to learn abstract concepts such as harmony, meter, and rhythm from raw musical data without any additional information. In this study, we investigate the effects of explicitly conditioning deep generative models with musically relevant information. Specifically, we study the effects of four different conditioning inputs on the performance of a recurrent monophonic melody generation model. Several combinations of these conditioning inputs are used to train different model variants which are then evaluated using three objective evaluation paradigms across two genres of music. The results indicate musically relevant conditioning significantly improves learning and performance, and reveal how this information affects learning of musical features related to pitch and rhythm. An informal subjective evaluation suggests a corresponding improvement in the aesthetic quality of generations.},

Efficient taxi cruising strategies are helpful to alleviate urban traffic congestions, reduce pollution emission, attenuate greenhouse gas, and also provide a fast service for passengers. However, in real scenarios, taxis cruising strategies are mostly based on their own experiences. At unfamiliar urban areas or during off-peak hours, drivers usually have no good idea for an optimal cruising strategy, which causes a low efficiency for service and also increases taxi operation costs. Considering that it is difficult to construct an analytical model for the taxis scheduling and cruising, in this paper, we put forward a data-driven model for multi-taxis cruising based on reinforcement learning. Furthermore, an evolutionary reinforcement learning method is proposed, which aims at improving the exploration of reinforcement learning and enhancing reinforcement learning to maximize the global reward in multi-agent tasks. In the experimental part, two other kinds of deep Q-learning methods and a roaming strategy are employed in the comparisons. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {The assessment of musical performances in, e.g., student competitions or auditions, is a largely subjective evaluation of a performer's technical skills and expressivity. Objective descriptors extracted from the audio signal have been proposed for automatic performance assessment in such a context. Such descriptors represent different aspects of pitch, dynamics and timing of a performance and have been shown to be reasonably successful in modeling human assessments of student performances through regression. This study aims to identify the influence of individual descriptors on models of human assessment in 4 categories: musicality, note accuracy, rhythmic accuracy, and tone quality. To evaluate the influence of the individual descriptors, the descriptors highly correlated with the human assessments are identified. Subsequently, various subsets are chosen using different selection criteria and the adjusted R-squared metric is computed to evaluate the degree to which these subsets explain the variance in the assessments. In addition, sequential forward selection is performed to identify the most meaningful descriptors. The goal of this study is to gain insights into which objective descriptors contribute most to the human assessments as well as to identify a subset of well-performing descriptors. The results indicate that a small subset of the designed descriptors can perform at a similar accuracy as the full set of descriptors. Sequential forward selection shows how around 33\% of the descriptors do not add new information to the linear regression models, pointing towards redundancy in the descriptors.},

Other, larger datasets such as OpenMIC only have weak labels, i.e., instrument presence or absence is annotated only for long snippets of a song. We explore an attention mechanism for handling weakly labeled data for multi-label instrument recognition. Attention has been found to perform well for other tasks with weakly labeled data. We compare the proposed attention model to multiple models which include a baseline binary relevance random forest, recurrent neural network, and fully connected neural networks. Our results show that incorporating attention leads to an overall improvement in classification accuracy metrics across all 20 instruments in the OpenMIC dataset. We find that attention enables models to focus on (or `attend to') specific time segments in the audio relevant to each instrument label leading to interpretable results.},

Second, features are extracted from this path and used to train a Random Forest classifier to detect the presence of the sample.

We propose to leverage both detailed task-specific features from spectrogram input and generic pre-trained features by introducing two regularization methods that integrate the information of both feature classes. The workload is kept low during inference as the pre-trained features are only necessary for training. In experiments with the pre-trained features VGGish, OpenL3, and a combination of both, we show that the proposed methods not only outperform baseline methods, but also can improve state-of-the-art models on several audio classification tasks.

  abstract = {Audio-to-audio alignment is the task of synchronizing two audio sequences with similar musical content in time. We investigated a large set of audio features for this task. The features were chosen to represent four different content-dependent similarity categories: the envelope, the timbre, note-onsets and the pitch. The features were subjected to two processing stages. First, a feature subset was selected by evaluating the alignment performance of each individual feature. Second, the selected features were combined and subjected to an automatic weighting algorithm. A new method for the objective evaluation of audio-to-audio alignment systems is proposed that enables the use of arbitrary kinds of music as ground truth data. We evaluated our algorithm by this method as well as on a data set of real recordings of solo piano music. The results showed that the feature weighting algorithm could improve the alignment accuracies compared to the results of the individual features.},

  abstract = {Clipping is an unpleasant recording artifact that occurs when an audio signal's level rises above a microphone's or AD converter's  maximum input level. As more audio and video recordings are being taken on mobile devices (sometimes in high sound level conditions  such as live concerts), clipping has become an issue that users encounter frequently. We present ClipAway: a web application that analyzes an audio file and automatically removes clipping from the audio file.  The following scenario illustrates the service we supply: 1) A user attends a live concert and creates an audio recording of the concert. 2)  The user listens to the recording at home and notices clipping, which causes the listening experience to be unsatisfactory. 3) The user  uploads the audio recording to the ClipAway website. 4) Audio processing occurs in the browser, and the user then exports a qualityenhanced  version of the recording. 5) The listening experience with the resulting audio file has significantly improved.  The advantage of browser-based processing is that it is more familiar and accessible to most users than a native solution, which would  likely require the user to install a standalone software or a digital audio workstation hosting a plugin for quality enhancement.  The declipping algorithm is split into two sections: clipping detection and clipping correction. Clipping detection involves the automatic  estimation of the clipping level and the subsequent localization of clipped regions. The clipping level is determined by identifying  anomalies in the signal's amplitude histogram near the positive and negative endpoints. The locations of clipping are determined by  identifying samples with amplitudes close to the clipping level where the signal has a near-horizontal slope. Clipping correction involves  replacing short clipped regions using spline interpolation and replacing long clipped regions through linear interpolation of time-frequency  bin magnitudes.},

Often, a single music recording is used as representative of a "song" even though different performances of the same song may reveal different properties. A performance is distinct in many ways from a (arguably more abstract) representation of a "song," "piece," or musical score. The characteristics of the (recorded) performance -as opposed to the score or musical idea- can have a major impact on how a listener perceives music. The analysis of music performance, however, has been traditionally only a peripheral topic for the MIR research community. This paper surveys the field of Music Performance Analysis (MPA) from various perspectives, discusses its significance to the field of MIR, and points out opportunities for future research in this field.},

Music technology \textendash{} encompassing musical instruments, sound generators, studio equipment and software, perceptual audio coding algorithms, and reproduction software and devices \textendash{} has shaped the way music is produced, performed, distributed, and consumed. The evolution of music technology enabled studios and hobbyist producers to produce music at a technical quality unthinkable decades ago and have affordable access to new effects as well as production techniques. Artists explore nontraditional ways of sound generation and sound modification to create previously unheard effects, soundscapes, or even to conceive new musical styles. The consumer has immediate access to a vast diversity of songs and styles and is able to listen to individualized playlists virtually everywhere and at any time. The most disruptive technological innovations during the past 130 years have probably been:1. The possibility to record and distribute recordings on a large scale through the gramophone. 2. The introduction of vinyl disks enabling high-quality sound reproduction. 3. The compact cassette enabling individualized playlists, music sharing with friends and mobile listening. 4. Digital audio technology enabling high quality professional-grade studio equipment at low prices. 5. Perceptual audio coding in combination with online distribution, streaming, and file sharing.

  abstract = {Different music performances of the same score may significantly differ from each other. It is obvious that not only the composer's work, the score, defines the listener's music experience, but that the music performance itself is an integral part of this experience. Music performers use the information contained in the score, but interpret, transform or add to this information. Four parameter classes can be used to describe a performance objectively: tempo and timing, loudness, timbre and pitch. Each class contains a multitude of individual parameters that are at the performers' disposal to generate a unique physical rendition of musical ideas. The extraction of such objective parameters is one of the difficulties in music performance research. This work presents an approach to the software-based extraction of tempo and timing, loudness and timbre parameters from audio files to provide a tool for the automatic parameter extraction from music performances. The system is applied to extract data from 21 string quartet performances and a detailed analysis of the extracted data is presented. The main contributions of this thesis are the adaptation and development of signal processing approaches to performance parameter extraction and the presentation and discussion of string quartet performances of a movement of Beethoven's late String Quartet op. 130.},

The proposed features capture not only amplitude, but also tonal and general spectral changes in the signal, aiming to represent as much rhythmic information as possible. The most and least informative features are identified through feature selection methods and are then tested using Support Vector Machines on five genre datasets concerning classification accuracy against a baseline feature set. Results show that the presented features provide comparable classification accuracy with respect to other genre classification approaches using periodicity histograms and display a performance close to that of much more elaborate up-to-date approaches for rhythm description. The use of bar boundary annotations for the texture frames has provided an improvement for the dance-oriented Ballroom dataset. The comparably small number of descriptors and the possibility of evaluating the influence of specific signal components to the general rhythmic content encourage the further use of the method in rhythm description tasks.},

  abstract = {Music performance assessment is a highly subjective task often relying on experts to gauge both the technical and aesthetic aspects of the performance from the audio signal. This article explores the task of building computational models for music performance assessment, i.e., analyzing an audio recording of a performance and rating it along several criteria such as musicality, note accuracy, etc. Much of the earlier work in this area has been centered around using hand-crafted features intended to capture relevant aspects of a performance. However, such features are based on our limited understanding of music perception and may not be optimal. In this article, we propose using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task and compare their performance against a baseline model using standard and hand-crafted features. We show that, using input representations at different levels of abstraction, DNNs can outperform the baseline models across all assessment criteria. In addition, we use model analysis techniques to further explain the model predictions in an attempt to gain useful insights into the assessment process. The results demonstrate the potential of using supervised feature learning techniques to better characterize music performances.},

Recent attempts in this direction have relied on learning disentangled representations from data such that the underlying factors of variation are well separated. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between disentanglement and controllability by conducting a systematic study using different supervised disentanglement learning algorithms based on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) architecture. Our experiments show that a high degree of disentanglement can be achieved by using different forms of supervision to train a strong discriminative encoder. However, in the absence of a strong generative decoder, disentanglement does not necessarily imply controllability. The structure of the latent space with respect to the VAE-decoder plays an important role in boosting the ability of a generative model to manipulate different attributes. To this end, we also propose methods and metrics to help evaluate the quality of a latent space with respect to the afforded degree of controllability.},

To this end, a novel deep learning-based approach for musical score inpainting is proposed. The designed model takes both past and future musical context into account and is capable of suggesting ways to connect them in a musically meaningful manner. To achieve this, we leverage the representational power of the latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder and train a Recurrent Neural Network which learns to traverse this latent space conditioned on the past and future musical contexts. Consequently, the designed model is capable of generating several measures of music to connect two musical excerpts. The capabilities and performance of the model are showcased by comparison with competitive baselines using several objective and subjective evaluation methods. The results show that the model generates meaningful inpaintings and can be used in interactive music creation applications. Overall, the method demonstrates the merit of learning complex trajectories in the latent spaces of deep generative models.},

We introduce a weighted contrastive loss suitable for regression tasks applied to a convolutional neural network and show that contrastive loss results in performance gains in regression tasks for MPA.

We show that the separation network informed of vocal activity learns to differentiate between vocal and non-vocal regions. Such a network thus reduces interference and artifacts better compared to the network agnostic to this side information. Results on the MIR1K dataset show that informing the separation network of vocal activity improves the separation results consistently across all the measures used to evaluate the separation quality.},

Towards this goal, we introduce the problem of Automatic Practice Logging (APL), including a discussion of the benefits and unique challenges it raises. We then describe a new dataset of over 600 annotated recordings of solo piano practice, which can be used to design and evaluate APL systems. After fram- ing our approach to the problem, we present an algorithm designed to align short segments of practice audio with reference recordings using pitch chroma and dynamic time warping.},

The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two dictionaries: a percussive dictionary initialized with pre-defined drum templates and a harmonic dictionary initialized with undefined entries. The harmonic dictionary is adapted to the non-percussive music content in a standard NMF procedure. The percussive dictionary is adapted to each individual signal in an iterative scheme: it is fixed during the decomposition process, and is updated based on the result of the previous convergence. Two template adap- tation methods are proposed to provide more flexibility and robustness in the case of unknown data. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated and compared to state of the art systems. The results show that template adaptation improves the transcription performance, and the detection accuracy is in the same range as more complex systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a drum transcription algorithm using partially fixed non-negative matrix factorization is presented. The pro- posed method allows users to identify percussive events in complex mixtures with a minimal training set. The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two parts: percussive part with pre-defined drum templates and harmonic part with un- defined entries. The harmonic part is able to adapt to the music content, allowing the algorithm to work in polyphonic mixtures. Drum event times can be simply picked from the percussive activation matrix with onset detection. The system is efficient and robust even with a minimal training set. The recognition rates for the ENST dataset vary from 56.7 to 78.9\% for three percussive instruments extracted from polyphonic music.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of drum playing technique detection in polyphonic mixtures of music is addressed. We focus on the identification of 4 rudimentary techniques: strike, buzz roll, flam, and drag. The specifics and the challenges of this task are being discussed, and different sets of features are compared, including various features extracted from NMF-based activation functions, as well as baseline spectral features. We investigate the capabil- ities and limitations of the presented system in the case of real-world recordings and polyphonic mixtures. To de- sign and evaluate the system, two datasets are introduced: a training dataset generated from individual drum hits, and ad- ditional annotations of the well-known ENST drum dataset minus one subset as test dataset. The results demonstrate issues with the traditionally used spectral features, and in- dicate the potential of using NMF activation functions for playing technique detection, however, the performance of polyphonic music still leaves room for future improvement.},

To build a computational model that provides a reliable assessment, the system must take into account various aspects of a performance including technical correctness and aesthetic standards. While some progress has been made in recent years, the search for an effective feature representation remains open-ended. In this study, we explore the possibility of using learned features from sparse coding. Specifically, we investigate three sets of features, namely a baseline set, a set of designed features, and a feature set learned with sparse coding. In addition, we compare the impact of two different input representations on the effectiveness of the learned features. The evaluation is performed on a dataset of annotated recordings of students playing snare exercises. The results imply the general viability of feature learning in the context of automatic assessment of music performances.},

  abstract = {In Western popular music, drums and percussion are an important means to emphasize and shape the rhythm, often defining the musical style. If computers were able to analyze the drum part in recorded music, it would enable a variety of rhythm-related music processing tasks. Especially the detection and classification of drum sound events by computational methods is considered to be an important and challenging research problem in the broader field of Music Information Retrieval. Over the last two decades, several authors have attempted to tackle this problem under the umbrella term Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT). This paper presents a comprehensive review of ADT research, including a thorough discussion of the task-specific challenges, categorization of existing techniques, and evaluation of several state-of-the-art systems. To provide more insights on the practice of ADT systems, we focus on two families of ADT techniques, namely methods based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Recurrent Neural Networks. We explain the methods' technical details and drum-specific variations and evaluate these approaches on publicly available datasets with a consistent experimental setup. Finally, the open issues and under-explored areas in ADT research are identified and discussed, providing future directions in this field.},

  abstract = {The qualitative assessment of music performances is a task that is influenced by technical correctness, deviations from established performance standards, and aesthetic judgment. Despite its inherently subjective nature, a quantitative overall assessment is often desired, as exemplified by US all-state auditions or other competitions. A model that automatically generates assessments from the audio data would allow for objective assessments and enable musically intelligent computer-assisted practice sessions for students learning an instrument. While existing systems are already able to provide similar basic functionality, they rely on the musical score as prior knowledge. In this paper, we present a score-independent system for assessing student instrument performances based on audio recordings. This system aims to characterize the performance with both well-established and custom-designed audio features, model expert assessments of student performances, and predict the assessment of unknown audio recordings. The results imply the viability of modeling human assessment with score-independent audio features. Results could lead towards more general software music tutoring systems that do not require score information for the assessment of student music performances.},

  abstract = {The recent increase in the accessibility and size of personal and crowd-sourced digital sound collections brought about a valuable resource for music creation. Finding and retrieving relevant sounds in performance leads to challenges that can be approached using music information retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we explore the use of MIR to retrieve and repurpose sounds in musical live coding. We present a live coding system built on SuperCollider enabling the use of audio content from Creative Commons (CC) sound databases such as Freesound or personal sound databases. The novelty of our approach lies in exploiting high-level MIR methods (e.g. query by pitch or rhythmic cues) using live coding techniques applied to sounds. We demonstrate its potential through the reflection of an illustrative case study and the feedback from four expert users. The users tried the system with either a personal database or a crowd-source database and reported its potential in facilitating tailorability of the tool to their own creative workflows. This approach to live repurposing of sounds can be applied to real-time interactive systems for performance and composition beyond live coding, as well as inform live coding and MIR research.},

  abstract = {Music information retrieval (MIR) has a great potential in musical live coding because it can help the musician\textendash programmer to make musical decisions based on audio content analysis and explore new sonorities by means of MIR techniques. The use of real-time MIR techniques can be computationally demanding and thus they have been rarely used in live coding; when they have been used, it has been with a focus on low-level feature extraction. This article surveys and discusses the potential of MIR applied to live coding at a higher musical level. We propose a conceptual framework of three categories: (1) audio repurposing, (2) audio rewiring, and (3) audio remixing. We explored the three categories in live performance through an application programming interface library written in SuperCollider, MIRLC. We found that it is still a technical challenge to use high-level features in real time, yet using rhythmic and tonal properties (midlevel features) in combination with text-based information (e.g., tags) helps to achieve a closer perceptual level centered on pitch and rhythm when using MIR in live coding. We discuss challenges and future directions of utilizing MIR approaches in the computer music field.},

  abstract = {The modeling of artificial, human-level creativity is becoming more and more achievable. In recent years, neural networks have been successfully applied to different tasks such as image and music generation, demonstrating their great potential in realizing computational creativity. The fuzzy definition of creativity combined with varying goals of the evaluated generative systems, however, makes subjective evaluation seem to be the only viable methodology of choice. We review the evaluation of generative music systems and discuss the inherent challenges of their evaluation. Although subjective evaluation should always be the ultimate choice for the evaluation of creative results, researchers unfamiliar with rigorous subjective experiment design and without the necessary resources for the execution of a large-scale experiment face challenges in terms of reliability, validity, and replicability of the results. In numerous studies, this leads to the report of insignificant and possibly irrelevant results and the lack of comparability with similar and previous generative systems. Therefore, we propose a set of simple musically informed objective metrics enabling an objective and reproducible way of evaluating and comparing the output of music generative systems. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed metrics with several experiments on real-world data.},

Principles of classical counterpoint as well as common voice-leading conven- tions are utilized by the system.
