I am happy to announce the release of [C++ code](https://github.com/alexanderlerch/libACA) accompanying the book ["An Introduction to Audio Content Analysis"](https://www.AudioContentAnalysis.org). The source code shows example implementations of basic approaches, features, and algorithms for music audio content analysis.

All implementations are also available in:
* [Matlab: ACA-Code](https://github.com/alexanderlerch/ACA-Code)
* [Python: pyACA](https://github.com/alexanderlerch/pyACA)
