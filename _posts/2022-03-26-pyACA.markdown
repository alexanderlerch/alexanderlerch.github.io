After a long time, I am happy to announce an update to my [pyACA package](https://pypi.org/project/pyACA).

Finally, the python content matches the Matlab code accompanying my [book on audio content analysis](https://www.audiocontentanalysis.org). However, most of the changes are under the hood: code clean-up, automated tests and automated packaging with github actions. Huge thanks to [Kaushal Sali](https://github.com/kaushalsali) for his help!

Check out the [code repo](https://github.com/alexanderlerch/pyACA) to learn more! I look forward to any feedback you might have.


All implementations are also available in:
* [Matlab: ACA-Code](https://github.com/alexanderlerch/ACA-Code)
* [C++: libACA](https://github.com/alexanderlerch/libACA)
